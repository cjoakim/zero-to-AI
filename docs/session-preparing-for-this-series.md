## Audience

- Anyone at 3Cloud interested in learning hands-on AI with Python, including:
  - Project Managers
  - Developers (Junior to Senior, Low-code to High-code, any programming language)
  - Data Engineers (Spark, Databricks)
  - Data Analysts
  - Data Scientists (ML)
  - AI Architects
  - AI Engineers
  - Testers
  - Business Analysts
  - Managers
  - And more...

## The Goal of this Series

- **The primary goal is to enable you to learn and implement hands-on AI solutions yourself**
  - The hands-on nature, IMO, enables you to truly learn AI
  - Hands-on means you can execute the lesson samples yourself, and comprehendthe code
  - Goal is 100-level, or 200, 300, or 400 level
  - To put you in a better position to serve our customers

### Secondary Goals

In order to achieve the above primary goal, we will, in this sequence:

- Introduce you to Application Development with Git, GitHub, and Python
  - At a minimum, have you "git clone" this GitHub repository for your use in this series
- Introduce you to the most relevant Azure PaaS Services for AI Applications
  - Storage, Foundry (LLMs), OpenAI, Cosmos DB, Search
- Introduce you to AI concepts and technologies
  - Document Intelligence, Knowledge Graphs, MCP, Agent Framework, Prompting, RAG, Vector Search, etc.
- Provide working code to jump-start your personal learning journey

### Are we going to cover everything you need to know about AI?

- No.  But we'll cover enough to jump-start your personal learning journey

### Is the series customized for me and my unique needs?

- No.  Obviously not, but the goal is to appeal to a broad audience wanting guidance and direction in their AI journey.


## My Goal

- Is to **"Teach you to Fish"** in these ~20 **bite-size** lessons/sessions
- Provide you with an understanding of the core concepts and technologies
- Provide you with a working codebase to jump-start your personal learning journey
- To encourage, coach, and guide you
  - But not teach you the details of each topic; my time is finite

### Why Python?

- Python is the most popular programming language in the world
- **Python is the most popular language for AI**
- Python is relatively easy to learn and use
- Python has a very broad range of use-cases 
  - AI/ML
  - Web Services and Apps
  - Data Science
  - System Administration
  - Ad-hoc scripting
  - Many others...
- Microsoft has a broad range of Python SDKs for Azure services
  - SDK = Software Development Kit
  - See [Microsoft Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)

### Why did I volunteer to create and present this series?

- I've seen a great need, at Microsoft, for technical enablement amongst my peers
- I'm seeing the same need at 3Cloud, especially as AI is transforming us so rapidly
- Hands-on enablement in Python and AI can unleash your understanding, skills, value, success
- To put us in a better position to understand and serve our customers

## Series Content - GitHub, Teams Meetings, Teams Channel

- All content will be in GitHub, for your reference
- Primitive markdown content (like this page), and the simplest-possible Python code
- A mix of concepts and hands-on; more hands-on
  - Description, Topics, Images, Demonstration, Links, and Pro Tips
- Minimal number of hyperlinks to external content
- No flashy PowerPoint presentations
- We'll record each Teams meeting for your reference

## Each Session

- "Bite-size" 30-minute Teams meetings to cover one topic
- First five minutes is for Q&A from previous Session
- Next 15-20 minutes is for presentation and demonstration (please be on mute)
  - Post your questions in the Teams meeting chat
- Last 5-10 minutes is for questions and discussion
- Sessions will be recorded for your reference

## Let's build a Learning Community in Teams

- Help each other.  Learn from each other
- I'll monitor the Teams channel, but my time for one-on-one conversations is limited
- I'd like to see leaders emerge in this channel, to help the others

## Azure

- You won't use Azure Portal in this series
- You don't have to provision Azure resources
- I'll share read-only keys to Azure resources instead (in a 3Cloud Subscription)
- This will enable you to focus on learning, not provisioning and DevOps
- But please learn in another Azure Subscription if you wish to

### Personal Azure Accounts 

- I encourage you to create one for your ongoing educational use
- [Create a Personal Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search)
- [Free Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search#Free-products)
- [Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit)
  - I've configured my personal account to have a spending limit of $20 per month

## Homework

- **Execute the lesson samples yourself, and look at the code**
- All code in this series can be executed from your laptop
- Visit the referenced links in each lesson

## Expectation/Hope

- The hardest sessions will be the first two on installing git, python, uv
- Get a working git, python, uv, and cloned repository on your laptop ASAP
- Please stay engaged, don't drop out if you feel you're falling behind
  - There will be time to catch up
- **Execute the lesson samples yourself, and look at the code**
- Be curious, lean forward, engage, learn

## Out of Scope

- Microsoft Fabric
- Databricks (but Jupyter and Notebooks are covered)
- Provisioning Azure resources
- DevOps
- LangChain and Semantic Kernel
  - The focus is on the new Microsoft Agent Framework
- Other programming languages - C#, Java, TypeScript, etc.
- Architecture and Design
  - The focus in this series is on the **Building-Blocks**, not designing entire applications

## In Summary, the Goal is to **"Teach you to Fish" regarding AI, with Python**
